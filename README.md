GridMashup-Wordpress-Theme
==========================

Grid Responsive Theme created by a modified mix of: Pronto (by WPExplorer), Pinbin (by Color Awesomeness) and WPMedium (by Charlie MERLAND).

This theme is built using "Pronto" as a basic framework.

Then were added features from "Pinbin" for the display of the grid and from "WPMedium" for the style of the individual article.

Once built this structure I changed the overall style and solved some problems. Thanks to the authors of the original themes.

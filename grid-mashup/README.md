Description
------------


This theme is built using "Pronto" as a basic framework.

Then were added features from "Pinbin" for the display of the grid and from "WPMedium" for the style of the individual article.

Once built this structure I changed the overall style and solved some problems. Thanks to the authors of the original themes.
